If you're using [SQL School](/) to prep for an interview on an Analytics team, you're not alone &mdash; we've received many questions and comments from folks hoping to land a sweet job analyzing data. We don't believe in teaching to a test &mdash; SQL School is designed to arm you with skills that will be helpful on the job but likely won't come up in an onsite interview. That said, some test prep is helpful, too. This quiz includes questions similar to those that we've personally heard (and asked) in interviews or that SQL School students have shared with us.


As most interviewers are looking for deep understanding and problem-solving ability, a mastery of the skills in the [basic](/the-basics/basic-concepts.html) and [intermediate](/intermediate/aggregation-functions.html) tutorials is recommended before attempting this quiz. Some questions also draw from the lessons on [Subqueries](/advanced/subqueries.html) and [Window Functions](/advanced/window-functions.html).

This quiz begins with conceptual questions, which are meant to assess your understanding of how SQL manipulates data. You don't need to actually write any code &mdash; just answer clearly. The later portion consists of technical questions, for which you will actually write SQL.

###Have a great question to add?
Much of the material for this quiz was created based on feedback from people using SQL School. We're excited to add more questions that help prepare people to become data analysts. If you have suggestions on how to improve the existing questions or have a question you think we should add, please email us at [sqlschool@modeanalytics.com](mailto:sqlschool@modeanalytics.com).
