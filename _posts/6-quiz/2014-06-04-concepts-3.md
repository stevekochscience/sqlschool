  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <strong>UNION only appends unique rows from the second table. UNION ALL appends all rows.</strong>
  <p>UNION ALL is faster because the only operation it performs is appending rows. UNION ALL must also remove duplicates, which is an expensive operation. It is conceptually similar to using COUNT() vs. COUNT(DISTINCT).</p>
