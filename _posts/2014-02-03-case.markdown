For the next few lessons, you'll work with data on College Football Players. This data was collected from ESPN on January 15, 2014 from the rosters listed on [this page](http://espn.go.com/college-football/teams) using a Python scraper [available here](https://github.com/mode/blog/blob/master/2014-01-16-football-hometowns/espn_cfb_scraper.py) In this particular lesson, you'll stick to roster information. This table is pretty self-explanatory &mdash; one row per player, with columns that describe attributes for that player. Run this query to check out the raw data:

    SELECT * FROM benn.college_football_players

###CASE
The `CASE` statement is SQL's way of handling if/then logic. The `CASE` statement is followed by at least one pair of `WHEN` and `THEN` statements &mdash; SQL's equivalent of IF/THEN. It must end with the `END` statement. The `ELSE` statement is optional, and provides a way to capture values not specified in the `WHEN`/`THEN` statements. It's easiest to understand in the context of an example:

    SELECT player_name,
           year,
           CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes'
                ELSE NULL END AS is_a_senior
      FROM benn.college_football_players

In plain english, here's what's happening:

1. The `CASE` statement checks each row to see if the conditional statement &mdash; `year = 'SR'` is true.
2. For any given row, if that conditional statement is true, the word "yes" gets printed in the column that we have named `is_a_senior`.
3. In any row for which the conditional statement is false, nothing happens in that row, leaving a null value in the `is_a_senior` column.
4. At the same time all this is happening, SQL is retrieving and displaying all the values in the `player_name` and `year` columns.

The above query makes it pretty easy to see what's happening because we've included the `CASE` statement along with the `year` column itself. You can check each row to see whether `year` meets the condition `year = 'SR'` and then see the result in the column generated using the `CASE` statement.

But what if you don't want null values in the `is_a_senior` column? The following query replaces those nulls with "no":

    SELECT player_name,
           year,
           CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes'
                ELSE 'no' END AS is_a_senior
      FROM benn.college_football_players

You can also define a number of outcomes in a `CASE` statement by including as many `WHEN`/`THEN` statements as you'd like:

    SELECT player_name,
           weight,
           CASE WHEN weight > 250 THEN 'over 250'
                WHEN weight > 200 THEN '200-250'
                WHEN weight > 175 THEN '175-200'
                ELSE 'under 175' END AS weight_group
      FROM benn.college_football_players

In the above example, the `WHEN`/`THEN` statements will get evaluated in the order that they're written. So if the value in the `weight` column of a given row is 300, it will produce a result of "over 250." Here's what happens if the value in the `weight` column is 180:

1. Check to see if `weight` is greater than 250. 180 is not greater than 250, so move on to the next `WHEN`/`THEN`
2. Check to see if `weight` is greater than 200. 180 is not greater than 200, so move on to the next `WHEN`/`THEN`
3. Check to see if `weight` is greater than 175. 180 **is** greater than 175, so record "175-200" in the `weight_group` column.

<!-- eventually draw decision tree diagram -->

While the above works, it's really best practice to create statements that don't overlap. `WHEN weight > 250` and `WHEN weight > 200` overlap for every value greater than 250, which is a little confusing. A better way to write the above would be:

    SELECT player_name,
           weight,
           CASE WHEN weight > 250 THEN 'over 250'
                WHEN weight > 200 AND weight <= 250 THEN '200-250'
                WHEN weight > 175 AND weight <= 200 THEN '175-200'
                ELSE 'under 175' END AS weight_group
      FROM benn.college_football_players

You can also string together multiple conditional statements with `AND` and `OR` the same way you might in a `WHERE` clause:

    SELECT player_name,
           CASE WHEN year = 'FR' AND position = 'WR' THEN 'frosh_wr'
                ELSE NULL END AS sample_case_statement
      FROM benn.college_football_players

###A quick review:

1. The `CASE` statement always goes in the `SELECT` clause
2. `CASE` must include the following components: `WHEN`, `THEN`, and `END`. `ELSE` is an optional component.
3. You can make any conditional statement using any [conditional operator](/the-basics/where-operators.html) between `WHEN` and `THEN`. This includes stringing together multiple conditional statements using `AND` and `OR`.
4. You can include multiple `WHEN` statements, as well as an `ELSE` statement to deal with any unaddressed conditions.

###Using CASE with aggregations
`CASE`'s slightly more complicated and substnatially more useful functionality comes from pairing it with aggregators. For example, let's say you want to only count rows that fulfill a certain condition. Since `COUNT` ignores nulls, you could use a `CASE` statement to evaluate the condition and produce null or non-null values depending on the outcome:

    SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
                ELSE 'Not FR' END AS year_group,
                COUNT(1) AS count
      FROM benn.college_football_players
     GROUP BY 1

Now, you might be thinking "why wouldn't I just use a `WHERE` clause to filter out the rows I don't want to count?" You could do that -- it would look like this:

    SELECT COUNT(1) AS fr_count
      FROM benn.college_football_players
     WHERE year = 'FR'

But what if you also wanted to count a couple other conditions? Limiting using the `WHERE` clause only allows you to count one condition. Here's an example of counting multiple conditions in one query:

    SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
                WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
                WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
                WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
                ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
                COUNT(1) AS count
      FROM benn.college_football_players
     GROUP BY 1

The above query is an excellent place to use numbers instead of columns in the `GROUP BY ` clause because repeating the `CASE` statement in the `GROUP BY` clause would make the query obnoxiously long. Note that if you do choose to repeat the entire `CASE` statement, you shouod remove the `AS year_group` column naming:

    SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
                WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
                WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
                WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
                ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
                COUNT(1) AS count
      FROM benn.college_football_players
     GROUP BY CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
                   WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
                   WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
                   WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
                   ELSE 'No Year Data' END

###Using CASE Within Aggregations
The previous example is an excellent lead-in to a primary use-`CASE` for `CASE` (sorry for that): creating histograms. In the previous examples, data was displayed vertically, but in some instances, you might want to show data horizontally. This is known as "Pivoting" (like a Pivot Table). Let's take the following query:

    SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
                WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
                WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
                WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
                ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
                COUNT(1) AS count
      FROM benn.college_football_players
     GROUP BY 1

And make re-orient it horizontally:

    SELECT CASE COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS fr_count,
                COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS so_count,
                COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS jr_count,
                COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS sr_count
      FROM benn.college_football_players

It's worth noting that going from horizontal to vertical orientation can be a substantially more difficult problem depending the circumstances, and is covered in greater depth in a [later lesson](/solutions-to-common-problems/pivoting-columns-to-rows.html).
