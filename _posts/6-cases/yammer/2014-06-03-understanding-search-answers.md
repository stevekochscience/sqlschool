###Developing Hypotheses
--something about what to do


<div id="solution"></div>
###The State of Search


* Autocomplete is used regularly, in 25% of sessions. Search is only used in about 10% of sessions.
* Users typically only use autocomplete once or twice per session, suggesting it's probably performing ok.
* Users typically run search more than once per session, suggesting search is not delivering good results.
* Furthermore, many searches do not have runs, and there tend to be fewer clicks per session than searches.
* People click on all ten results frequently, and only the first result slightly more often than others, suggesting the ordering is not good either.
* Many users do not return to searching in the month following their first search, while many users do return to autocomplete searches.

This all suggests that autocomplete is performing ok, while search runs are not.
