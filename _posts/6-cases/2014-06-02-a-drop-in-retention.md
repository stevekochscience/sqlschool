Yammer's Analysts are responsible for triaging product and business problems as they come up. In many cases, these problems surface through key metric dashboards that execs and managers check daily.

### The Problem

You show up to work Tuesday morning, March 25, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user retention dashboards. You fire them up, and something immediately jumps out:

<a href="https://modeanalytics.com/benn/reports/f34ca3417b4e/embed" class="mode-embed">Mode Analysis</a><script src="https://modeanalytics.com/embed/embed.js"></script>

The above chart shows engagement on a rolling 28-day basis: any individual point can be interpreted as the number of users who engaged with the product at some point within the 28-day period leading up to that date. You will notice that the point on February 28, 2014 shows **XX** engaged users â€” that's the total number of people who engaged between February 1 and February 28. It may be helpful to see the code that produces the above query, which you can find by clicking the link in the footer of the chart.

### The Solution

You are responsible for determining what caused the dip shown above and, if appropriate, recommending solutions for the problem.

1. Before you even touch the data, come up with a list of possible causes for the dip in retention shown in the chart above. Make a list and determine the order in which you will check them. Make sure to note how you will test each hypothesis.
1b. Think carefully about the criteria you use to order them and write down the criteria as well

2. Once you have an ordered list of possible problems, start to work your way through the list in order to determine the source of the drop in engagement. As you explore, make sure to save your work.
2b. Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions? If so, what are they and how will you test them? If they are questions that you can't answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?

3. What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip? What, if anything, should the company do in response?
