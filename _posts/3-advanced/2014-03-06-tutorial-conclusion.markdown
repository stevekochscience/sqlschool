Congratulations on finishing SQL School! You're more than ready to apply your skills to real analytical problems. Of course, the tricky part comes in applying these tools in unfamiliar situations, so expect to get stumped every now and again.

You might get frustrated when you've got an idea of how to solve a problem or how you'd like to manipulate data but just can't think through how you might code it up &mdash; that's pretty normal. At Mode, we've found that the best way to deal with these types of problems is to see what others have done and try to understand by looking at their code. To help with this, we've assembled a library of solutions to common problems like "I want to pivot my data from being stored as rows to being stored as columns."

You can [learn more about the library here](/common-problems/solutions-intro.html), or you can dive straight into some examples in the [SQL School Main Index](/).

###Applying Your Skills
Along the lines of the library of common problems, we recommend unleashing your newfound analytical prowess on some work that someone else has already done. You can find some great examples in Mode's [Explore section](https://modeanalytics.com/explore).

<!--
If you're planning to use your SQL skills at work, you should start by learning about how your company stores its data. If your company already has an organization in Mode, you can do this by [searching pre-existing work](), but we still recommend talking to some actual humans. Of course, you can use Mode to see who's working on projects that are relevant to you to figure out exactly who you need to talk to.

If your company doesn't use Mode, you can set it up pretty easily &mdash; just follow these directions to [create an Organization and connect to data]().
