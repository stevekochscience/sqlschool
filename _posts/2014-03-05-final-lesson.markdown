###Moving On
<!-- something generic-->

The tricky part comes in applying these tools in unfamiliar situations, so expect to get stumped every now and again.

You might get frustrated when you've got an idea of how to solve a problem or how you'd like to manipulate data but just can't think through how you might code it up &mdash; that's pretty normal. At Mode, we've found that the best way to deal with these types of problems is to see what others have done and try to understand by looking at their code. To help with this, we've assembled a library of solutions to common problems like "I want to pivot my data from being stored as rows to being stored as columns."

You can [check out the library here](LINK).
