Once you've got the basics of SQL down, the challenge lies in combining them in clever ways that lead you to the answers to your questions. In many ways, that's harder than learning syntax. Fortunately, though, you're not totally on your own.

Most of the problems you're likely to run into have been solved before. Maybe not as they relate to your specific domain, but in terms of using SQL to manipulate data in a certain way, chances are you're not the first. We've put this section together to provide solutions to the most commonly-faced data manipulation problems, along with clear explanations of how and why they might be applied.

If you run into a problem that's not listed here, we recommend searching [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com). You should also [email us](mailto:sqlschool@modeanalytics.com) and let us know so that we can add a solution.

The best way to use this section is to [browse from the index](/) and pick the problems that are most relevant to you. Good luck!
