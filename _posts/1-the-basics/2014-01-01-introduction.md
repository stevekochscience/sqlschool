###Welcome to SQL School
This tutorial is designed for people who want to answer questions with data. For many, SQL is the "meat and potatoes" of data analysis &mdash;it is used for accessing, cleaning, and analyzing data that is stored in databases. It's very easy to learn, but is employed by the world's largest companies to solve incredibly challenging problems.

SQL School is designed for aspiring analysts who have used Excel a little bit, but have no SQL experience. If you're already somewhat familiar with SQL or find the lessons to be a bit slow, check out the [table of contents](/toc.html) and start in the place that's right for you.

Though some of the lessons may be useful for software developers using SQL in their applications, this tutorial doesn't cover how to set up SQL databases or how to use them in software applications&mdash;it is not a comprehensive resource for aspiring software developers.

###How SQL School Works
The entire demo is meant to be completed using Mode, so you should <a href="https://modeanalytics.com" target="_blank">open up another browser window to Mode</a>. You'll retain the most information if you run the example queries and try to understand results, and complete the practice exercises.

*Note: You will need to have a Mode user account in order to start the tutorial. You can sign up for one at [modeanalytics.com](http://modeanalytics.com)*.
