Learning SQL is the first step to contributing to the Mode community. It's not too hard to learn -- this tutorial will take you through the basics and only takes about 30 minutes to complete.

The entire demo is contained within Mode, so you should <a href="http://modeanalytics.com" target="_blank">open up another browser window to Mode</a> and get ready to get started.

*Note: You will need to have a Mode user account in order to start the tutorial. If you do not already have one, follow the instructions on the Mode homepage to sign up.*

It's also important to note that this tutorial focuses entirely on using SQL to read and analyze data &mdash; it is not a comprehensive resource for aspiring software developers (though it may be a good place to start).
