<h3>Up your data analysis Skills</h3>
<p>SQL School is designed for people who want to answer questions with data—and have a bit of Excel experience. For many, SQL is the "meat and potatoes" of data analysis —it is used for accessing, cleaning, and analyzing data that is stored in databases. It's very easy to learn and is employed by the world's largest companies to solve incredibly challenging problems.</p>

<p>If you're already somewhat familiar with SQL, jump to the <a href="http://sqlschool.modeanalytics.com/">table of contents</a> and start in the place that's right for you. Though some of the lessons may be useful for software developers using SQL in their applications, this tutorial doesn't cover how to set up SQL databases or how to use them in software applications.</p>

<h3>It's Interactive!</h3>
<p>SQL School is designed to be interactive. We find that students who run example queries and work to understand the results of the practice problems seem to retain information best. To complete the practice problems as you read the lessons, <a href="https://modeanalytics.com/" target="_blank">open up Mode in another browser window</a>&mdash;all the data you'll need is ready and waiting!</p>

<p>Note: You'll need a Mode account in order to start the tutorial. You can sign up for a free account at <a href="http://modeanalytics.com/signup" target="_blank">modeanalytics.com</a>.</p>
