###Welcome to SQL School!

Learning SQL is the first step to contributing to the Mode community. It's not too hard to learn &mdash; once you get through the Intermediate section, you should be able to understand most queries you come across in Mode!

The entire demo is meant to be completed using Mode, so you should <a href="http://stealth.modeanalytics.com" target="_blank">open up another browser window to Mode</a>. You'll retain the most information if you run the example queries and try to understand results, and complete the practice exercises.

*Note: You will need to have a Mode user account in order to start the tutorial. If you do not already have one, [drop us an email to be added to the private beta](mailto:info@modeanalytics.com)*.

It's also important to note that this tutorial focuses entirely on using SQL to read and analyze data&mdash;it is not a comprehensive resource for aspiring software developers (though it may be a good place to start).
